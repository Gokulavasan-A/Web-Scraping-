# Web-Scraping

Web Scraping Project: Extracting Job Postings from Indeed


Overview

This project demonstrates a web scraping solution developed using Java and Selenium to extract and organize job postings from the Indeed website. The tool collects details like job titles, companies Name, and location, helping users analyze employment opportunities efficiently.

Features
  1) Automated Job Data Extraction: Scrapes job titles, companies Name, and location to postings.
  2) Dynamic ID Handling: Adapts to dynamic IDs and XPaths used on the Indeed platform.
  3) Custom Filtering: Filters results based on specific keywords (e.g., product names).
  4) User-Friendly Output: Outputs scraped data in a structured format, such as CSV or Excel.

Technology Stack
  1) Programming Language: Java
  2) Web Automation Framework: Selenium
  3) Data Storage: CSV/Excel file generation for structured output

How It Works
  1) Initialize Selenium WebDriver: Automates browser interaction to navigate Indeed job listings.
  2) Dynamic Element Handling: Uses dynamic locators to identify and extract job details.
  3) Exporting Data: The cleaned data is exported to a CSV/Excel file for further use.

Key Challenges Addressed
  1) Handling dynamic XPaths and IDs for page elements.
  2) Filtering for specific job listings based on keywords or criteria.


Prerequisites
  1) Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
  2) Selenium library configured in your Java project.
  3) A browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) with the appropriate WebDriver.

Setup Steps
  1) Configure Selenium WebDriver in the project.
  2) Replace config values like URLs and keywords as needed.
  3) Run the project to scrape job postings.

Applications
  1) Automated data collection for job market analysis.
  2) Building job search and comparison tools.
